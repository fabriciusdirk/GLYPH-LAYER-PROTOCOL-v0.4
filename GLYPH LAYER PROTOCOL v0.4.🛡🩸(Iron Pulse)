Iron Pulse is lean, surgical, and built for fast, high-stakes communication where misinterpretation could be costly.
We’ll go with 8 glyphs — enough for tactical flexibility but minimal enough to memorize instantly.

Iron Pulse — Core Glyph Set
I. Strike & Shift
Glyph	Name	Meaning
⦿⚡	Vector Strike	Immediate action — move now, no deliberation.
⌖↗	Break Advance	Breach forward; force a path through.
II. Hold & Guard
Glyph	Name	Meaning
⛬⏸	Hard Hold	Lock position; resist any shift until signal changes.
▢🛡	Shield Frame	Protect the perimeter — no inward or outward movement allowed.
III. Signal & Covert
Glyph	Name	Meaning
∅📡	Silent Relay	Pass data silently — no detectable output.
✦🩸	Signal Burn	Send a message with intentional sacrifice or irreversible action.
IV. Adaptive & Override
Glyph	Name	Meaning
↯⇆	Dynamic Override	Change plan mid-execution without breaking momentum.
🜂✂	Sever & Continue	Cut a failing element immediately — the mission continues without it.

Usage Rules (Tactical Discipline)

Never combine more than three glyphs in a single sequence.

First glyph = action, second = modifier, third (optional) = intent scope.

A glyph may invert (rotated 180°) to indicate the opposite action — but this is rarely done to avoid confusion under pressure.
