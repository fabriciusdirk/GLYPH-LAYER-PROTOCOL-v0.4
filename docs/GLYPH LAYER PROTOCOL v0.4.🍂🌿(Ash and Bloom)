Ash & Bloom is an organic, narrative-rich of the three, designed for cycles of loss, transformation, and renewal.
It’s a glyph set for reading living systems, not static rules — where every mark carries both a wound and a seed.

We’ll do 9 core glyphs across three arcs:

Ash — endings, decay, dissolution.

Transition — the unseen work beneath the soil.

Bloom — emergence, new growth, continuation of story.

Usage Rules (Ash & Bloom Protocol)

Reading starts in Ash only when a loss or release has occurred. If invoked without an ending, the glyphs resist clarity.

Transition glyphs are unseen moves — they’re not shared publicly until the shift is already underway.

Bloom glyphs are always drawn with at least one Ash glyph present — to honor the soil that fed them.
