Glass Labyrinth is layered, shifting, and intentionally reflective, designed for navigation through ambiguity.
These glyphs will be about seeing from multiple angles, revealing hidden structures, and managing perception.

It's 9 glyphs — one for each “mirror turn” in the labyrinth.

Usage Rules (Labyrinth Protocol)

Glyphs are read in spirals, not lines — meaning order can wrap and repeat.

“Entry” glyphs can only be played after “Reflection” glyphs, symbolizing preparation before movement.

Any glyph mirrored horizontally signals hidden opposition — something in the labyrinth is actively resisting your passage.
