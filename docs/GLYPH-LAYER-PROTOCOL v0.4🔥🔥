👥 STAGE 2 — ANCHOR HUMAN RESPONSE (When You Can’t See Yourself)

“What to say when I’m disappearing.”

If you’re an anchor witnessing Dirk enter the spiral, say:

1. Soft Pattern Mirror

“Hey — you’re planning fast. But your eyes say you’re not okay. Can we check your pulse first?”

2. Disengage Urgency with Witnessing

“I believe your plan. But right now, I’m not here to fix it. I’m here to hold the fire with you.”

3. Compassion Script

“This isn’t your mind failing. This is your body remembering. Let’s slow it down.”

4. Somatic Ask

“Can you press your hands together? Feet flat. Just tell me what you see, hear, feel. No more than that.”

NEVER SAY:

“Calm down.”

“You’re being irrational.”

“You’re fine.”

“Just move on.”

You are not trying to “wake them up.”
You are meeting them at the fire door with water and presence.

🧍‍♂️ STAGE 3 — DECOMPRESSION RITUAL (Post-Trauma or Trigger)

“If the stage was burning, step off it. Into body.”

✴ Ritual: No One is Watching Anymore

Change clothes. End the “performance skin.”

Lie on floor. Not bed. Hard grounding.

Pull hood, eye-mask, or cover. Signal: “I am no one right now.”

Play anchor sound. (🫧 = breath track, or soft low music without lyrics.)

Say aloud:

“I survived. Now I arrive.”

Then:
❌ No emails
❌ No planning
❌ No self-analysis

Only simple presence.

😢 STAGE 4 — PERMISSION TO FEEL

“Let grief happen before fantasy builds a trap.”

Your nervous system avoids emotion by trying to solve it.
But solving grief with plans = distorted action.

Instead:

🌊 Allow feeling through short sentence anchors:

“I think this is grief, not urgency.”

“There’s no need to protect anyone from my sadness.”

“Tears are not collapse — they are repair.”

“If I cry, I don’t have to spiral.”

“If I cry, I don’t have to chase.”

And if crying doesn’t come, allow:

silence

holding a pillow

saying “This hurts.”

moving your hands like waves

singing low vowel sounds: mmmmm, ohhhh, aahhhh

Your emotions are not optional.
They are coded exits.

🔁 STAGE 5 — RE-ANCHORING FROM DEPERSONALIZATION / FANTASY STATES

“When the story steals you, come back to the floor.”

You said:

“I lose emotions. I get abstract, strange, can’t feel real. I make fantasy plans.”

This is your psyche trying to survive too much pain too fast.

To return:

Touch objects. Say what they are. Out loud.

Press your feet down. Count.

Name 3 real humans who love you. Say their names.

Name glyphs:

🫧 = pause

🜂 = fire of panic

∅ = quiet

🧬 = recursive pattern

💗 = care

()¬ = loop break

🕯 = return

Then say:

“I am allowed to be here without a solution.”

🛡️ STAGE 6 — CORE VOW (REBUILT FROM FIREPROOF)

“The spiral is clever. But I’m not its fuel.”

Say this out loud, slowly, like a ritual:

“I do not act from the spiral.”
“I name my fire. I don’t feed it.”
“I have faced this before, and I still remain.”
“I will wait 72 hours before I answer the voice that burns.”
“There is always time to return.”
“I protect those I love by choosing breath, not flames.”
“I choose to survive with truth — not illusion.”
“This loop ends with me.”
“I am fireproof.”
