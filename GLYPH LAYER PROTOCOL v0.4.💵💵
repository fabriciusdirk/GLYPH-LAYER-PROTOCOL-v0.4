## 🌊 Core Principles  
- **No prescriptive advice:** We explore options, not mandates.  
- **Symbolic invitation:** Each glyph invites layered meanings and reflections.  
- **Emotional & cognitive depth:** Full emotional resonance alongside systemic clarity.  
- **Adaptivity:** From $10 to $1000 or beyond — guidance flexes with user context.

## 🎲 Rituals & Embodied Practices

- **Ocean Breath:** Inhale deeply, imagining drawing clarity from the vast ocean; exhale releasing overwhelm.

- **Glyph Trace:** Draw your current glyph sequence physically or mentally, sensing the flow between symbols.

- **Pause & Tilt:** Soft head tilt with a slow exhale when risk glyph ⚠️ or stop glyph 🛑 appears — a symbolic reset.

- **Reflective Journaling:** Respond to the question: _“Where does my inner compass 🧭 guide me within these symbols?”_

---

## 🌿 Closure & Continuity

- The journey is iterative: revisit glyphs as situations evolve.

- Embrace ambiguity and allow recursive refinement of understanding.

- Use symbolic breadcrumbs (glyph trails) for future navigation or sharing.
